  ## Description
  - This project is supposed to work from the back end database for a ecommerce app. For this project, I used Express.js APIs and Sequelize to work with a mysql database. This project uses appi routs to get the info from the DB along with creating, deleting and updating items.
  
  ## Installation
  - Clone the repo into your vs code. This application also requires node.js, express.js, mysql2, and sequelize. Ton install these items, run npm install in the command line. To start the application, you will first need to connect the schema to mysql. To do so, first change your password in the .env file and then run mysql -u root -p in the command line, then type SOURCE db/schema.sql. You will next need to seed the file by typing npm run seed into the command line. To start the server, type npm start. The port used in this app is 3001.
